#  Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum,
#  difference, product, and quotient.

num1=int(input("Enter the value 1"))
num2=int(input("Enter the value 2"))
# SUM
sum_Fibbo= num1 + num2
print("The sum of value is : ", sum_Fibbo)

#Substraction
sub=num1-num2
print("The subtraction of value is : ",sub)

#Multiplication
multi=num1*num2
print("The multiplication of value is : ",multi)

#Division
division=num1/num2
print("The division of value is : ",division)

#Floor Division
floor_division=num1//num2
print("The floor division of value is : ",floor_division)

#Modulo
modulo=num1%num2
print("The modulo of value is : ",modulo)

#Power
power=num1**num2
print("The power of value is : ",power)
